This is a Git Hashing exercise.

1. Make hash_script an executable with: 'chmod +x hash_script' 
2. Run hash_script with a 4-digit integer as an argument (I used 3008 as an example): './hash_script 3008'
3. The script checks if the correct number of arguments is provided in the correct form (4-digit integer)
   Then it calculates the hash using 'sha256sum' and outputs the result in hash_output.txt
